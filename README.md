# RSS Reader - PWA - [Work in Progress]
Small rss reader webapp, to test out PWA features

### One-Time Setup

Must have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed:

1. `git clone https://github.com/pingboard/next-pwa-boilerplate`
2. `npm i`
3. Replace all images in `./static/graphics/` with your desired app icons, splash screens, and thumbnail for social sharing. If you have Sketch, you can use the artboards included in `./graphics.sketch`. Ensure that all replacement graphics include the same filenames, file type, and dimensions.

### Run

`npm run dev` and go to http://localhost:3000
